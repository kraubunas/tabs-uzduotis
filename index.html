    <h1>Dodge Challenger Demon</h1>
    <img src="./app/img/challenger.jpg" alt="dodge">
    <p id="paragraph">The Demon is a limited production wide-body and extreme (drag race level) performance variant of the already
    high-performance Challenger SRT Hellcat. It debuted during the New York Auto Show in April 2017. The Demon uses an all-new 6.2-liter V8 engine equipped with a 2.7-liter supercharger, which is rated at 808 hp (603 kW;
    819 PS) with 91 octane gasoline and 840 hp (626 kW; 852 PS) with 100 octane fuel or higher (both outputs are with the red key fob supplied with the car). Torque stands at 770 lb⋅ft (1,044 N⋅m) on 100 octane fuel. The car weighs 215 lb (98kg) less than the Hellcat, the total being 4,254 lb (1,930 kg). The SRT Demon uses a set of road tires by Nitto Tire, called the NT05R. The tires are the 315/40R18 variations at both front and rear. The tires are targeted for the drag strip, but have enough tread pattern to make them legal for the road. This tire, although an NT05R consumer tire, is a variation built specifically to withstand the power output of the Demon. This makes the Challenger SRT Demon the first production car to contain a set of drag radial road tires. The SRT Demon contains a system that is used specifically for drag racing called transbrake. Dodge uses a unique transbrake that puts the transmission in 1st gear and 2nd gear simultaneously, holding the Demon stationary. This is used along with the car's torque converter to build up hydraulic pressure before launch. The power-to-weight ratio of the SRT Demon is 418 hp (312 kW; 424 PS) per ton on 91 octane gasoline and 435 hp (324 kW;
    441 PS) per ton on 100 octane or higher.</p>

    <p id="paragraph">For 2020, the Charger Hellcat comes standard with the "widebody" to accommodate an improved tire/suspension package.
    Dodge also added a new trim for 2020 called the SRT Hellcat Redeye. The Hellcat Redeye comes standard with the 797 hp
    (594 kW; 808 PS) V8 engine. The 2020 Charger Pursuit is only available in the RWD V6 and AWD V8 models, with the RWD
    V8 model being discontinued. Both Pursuit models now feature eight-speed automatic transmissions.</p>

    <h1>Dodge Durango HellCat</h1>
    <img src="./app/img/durango.jpg" alt="dodge">
    <p id="paragraph">For 2021, the Durango receives updated exterior styling, with a revised bumper and headlights, three grille textures,
    and six new wheel designs. The interior features a new instrument panel with Uconnect 5; an 8.4-inch screen is standard
    on SXT and GT models, while R/T and Citadel models have a 10.1-inch touchscreen. An SRT Hellcat model with a 710 hp
    supercharged 6.2 L Hemi V8 was available for 2021 only, after which it was discontinued due to emissions
    requirements. With the discontinuation of the smaller Journey, the Durango becomes the only SUV in the Dodge vehicle
    lineup as of 2021.</p>
